CHORES
======

A currently very rough work-in-progress to track various server chores
and make sure they're running as scheduled.

The client shoots off requests to a server, which records and displays
the status.

You can specify how often a job should run, how long it should take,
etc and the server will let you know if a particular chore is out of date.
